# Rhyddle
Guess today's melody by pressing the note buttons and seeing how it compares to the answer wordle style! Grey means that that note is not in the melody, yellow means that it is but in a different position and green means that it's in the right position! Trade your unused guesses for hints, and listen to your guesses in real time to get a feel for what they sound like!

# Discontinuation Statement
Currently, this project is being left unfinished as I would prefer to work on other projects that are more suited for my resume, and to study for university. There is a chance that I will work on this in the summer of 2024 but if I have other better projects then do not expect this to be finished. 

If you have tried the [proof of concept](https://aleifericsson.github.io/rhyddle/) think this concept has potential feel free to email me at alifnafili@yahoo.com and I will consider implementing your request if you so have one.
